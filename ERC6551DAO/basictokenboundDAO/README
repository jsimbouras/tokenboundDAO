SimpleDAO

SimpleDAO is a basic Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create accounts, deposit funds, withdraw funds, and vote on proposals within the DAO.

## Smart Contracts

The repository contains the following smart contracts:

- **SimpleDAO.sol**: The main contract implementing the DAO functionality. It provides functions to create an account, deposit funds, withdraw funds, and vote on proposals.
- **Account.sol**: A contract representing individual user accounts within the DAO. It allows users to manage their account balances and interact with the DAO.
- **AccountRegistry.sol**: A registry contract that manages the creation and deployment of accounts. It ensures that each ERC721 token is associated with a unique account.
- **CrossChainExecutorList.sol**: A contract to manage trusted cross-chain executors. It allows the DAO to enable or disable trusted executors on different chains.
- **MinimalReceiver.sol**: A contract that allows receiving Ether and interacting with ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens. It is used as a base contract for receiving funds and tokens in the DAO.

## Dependencies

The following external dependencies are required to compile and run the smart contracts:

- OpenZeppelin Contracts: A library for secure smart contract development. Version x.x.x.

## Getting Started

To get started with SimpleDAO, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies mentioned above.
2. Compile the smart contracts using the Solidity compiler.
3. Deploy the smart contracts to an Ethereum development network or mainnet.
4. Interact with the deployed contracts using a web interface or Ethereum client libraries.

## Functionality

The SimpleDAO provides the following functions:

- **createAccount**: Allows users to create an account within the DAO by providing an ERC721 token and token ID. Each account is associated with a unique ERC721 token.
- **deposit**: Users can deposit funds into their account within the DAO.
- **withdraw**: Users can withdraw funds from their account within the DAO.
- **vote**: Users can vote on proposals within the DAO using their account.
- **setCrossChainExecutor**: Only accessible to the owner of the DAO, this function enables or disables a trusted cross-chain executor.
