# SimpleDAO

SimpleDAO is a basic Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create accounts, deposit funds, and withdraw funds within the DAO.

## Smart Contracts

The repository contains the following smart contracts:

- **SimpleDAO.sol**: The main contract implementing the DAO functionality.
- **Account.sol**: A contract representing individual user accounts within the DAO.
- **AccountRegistry.sol**: A registry contract that manages the creation and deployment of accounts.
- **CrossChainExecutorList.sol**: A contract to manage trusted cross-chain executors.
- **MinimalReceiver.sol**: A contract that allows receiving Ether and interacting with ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens.

## Dependencies

The following external dependencies are required to compile and run the smart contracts:

- OpenZeppelin Contracts: A library for secure smart contract development. Version x.x.x.

## Getting Started

To get started with SimpleDAO, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies mentioned above.
2. Compile the smart contracts using the Solidity compiler.
3. Deploy the smart contracts to an Ethereum development network or mainnet.
4. Interact with the deployed contracts using a web interface or Ethereum client libraries.
